TITLE:
Two Ancient Ways Humans Organized Knowledge

LEFT PANEL: Decentralized (Many Powers)
- Many centers of authority
- Specialized roles (war, sea, crops, crafts)
- Local variation is normal
- Flexible and adaptive
Icon idea: branching network or constellation

RIGHT PANEL: Centralized (One Power)
- Single ultimate authority
- Standardized texts and teachings
- Shared rules across distance
- Strong identity and coherence
Icon idea: single pillar or tree trunk

FOOTER:
These are structural patterns, not value judgments. Both still appear in how we organize institutions today.
