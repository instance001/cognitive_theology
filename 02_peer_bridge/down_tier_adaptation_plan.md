# Down-Tier Adaptation Plan

This document outlines how to translate the academic manuscript on polytheistic and monotheistic organizational logics into multiple public-facing tiers while preserving structural accuracy and avoiding theological controversy.

## Goals

- Maintain strict neutrality about belief.
- Present only structural comparisons.
- Provide accessible formats for students, general readers, and media audiences.
- Offer reusable building blocks for talks, videos, and teaching.

## Tiers

- Tier B: Undergraduate / educated public reading.
- Tier C: General public article.
- Tier D: YouTube / livestream script.
- Tier E: School-level explanation.
- Tier L: Infographic text.
- Tier M: Public FAQ.

Each tier translates the same core idea:

> Different religious systems evolved different ways of organizing authority and knowledge. These structures still appear in how human groups organize themselves today.

The following sections summarize the key messaging, tone, and guardrails for each tier.

### Messaging Guardrails

- No claims about which system is “better”.
- No claims about which beliefs are “true”.
- No suggestion that modern institutions come from religion; only structural resemblance.
- Emphasis on patterns, not metaphysics.

This plan serves as the bridge between the academic text and all derived public materials.
