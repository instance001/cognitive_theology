# Prepared Responses to Anticipated Peer Review Comments

## 1. On Causation vs. Structural Analogy

If a reviewer suggests that the paper implies causal influence of ancient religion on modern institutions, the response is:

> Thank you for highlighting this important point. The manuscript has been clarified to emphasize that it identifies structural analogies rather than genealogical descent. No historical derivation is claimed; the focus is on recurring organizational patterns.

## 2. On Oversimplification

If a reviewer is concerned about oversimplification of complex traditions:

> This concern is well taken. The article explicitly treats “polytheism” and “monotheism” as ideal types used to analyze specific structural dimensions. A short methodological note has been added to underline that real traditions are diverse and often hybrid.

## 3. On Normativity

If a reviewer sees normative evaluation:

> The language has been reviewed to avoid any implication of superiority or inferiority. Terms now clearly refer to functional roles (e.g., suitability for managing variation) rather than metaphysical or moral value.

## 4. On Modern Extensions

If a reviewer questions the extension to secular institutions:

> Additional references to institutional theory have been added, and the text now stresses that parallels are analytical, not historical. The section is framed as an application of the conceptual framework to familiar organizational forms.

These prepared responses may be adapted to the precise wording of actual reviews.
