# Structural Commentary & Reference Notes

These notes accompany the main manuscript and clarify methodological choices.

1. **Comparative Scope**  
   The paper restricts itself to structural features: authority distribution, canon formation, variation management, and institutional mechanisms. It does not attempt a comprehensive history of any single tradition.

2. **Avoidance of Normative Claims**  
   Terms such as “strengths” or “limitations” refer solely to functional suitability for particular organizational challenges. No metaphysical or moral judgments are implied.

3. **Polytheistic Variation**  
   Polytheistic systems are treated as coherent architectures in their own right. Variation is described as an expected and generative feature, not as disorder.

4. **Monotheistic Canonization**  
   Canon formation is framed as a process of stabilization and boundary-setting, analogous to standardization in secular institutions.

5. **Modern Analogy**  
   When the paper notes structural resemblances between religious and secular institutions, it does not claim historical derivation. The focus is on recurring organizational solutions.

6. **Integrative Framework**  
   The integrative model in Part III is presented as an analytical construct, not as a proposal for religious or political reform.

7. **Audience**  
   The manuscript is written for scholars in religious studies, history, anthropology, and institutional theory, and aims to be readable across these fields.
